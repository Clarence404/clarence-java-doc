# Clarence Java Doc

**Personal Development Summary and Technology Notes**

This project is a personal technical documentation site built with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), aiming to systematically organize and summarize my daily development experiences and technical knowledge.

It mainly covers a wide range of backend development and system design topics, including but not limited to:
- Java Core and Frameworks (Spring, Microservices)
- Databases (MySQL, SQL Optimization)
- Caching Systems (Redis, Caffeine, Guava Cache)
- JVM Internals and Performance Tuning
- High Concurrency and Distributed Systems
- Design Patterns and Architectural Principles
- Networking (Netty, Protocols)
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- IoT (Internet of Things) Solutions
- Artificial Intelligence Basics
